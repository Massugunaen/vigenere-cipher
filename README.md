# Vigenere_cipher
My version of vigenere cipher.
The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.
\n Feel free to use it, and even more so upgrade it and develop new methods of encrypting/decrypting.
